# SSA: Sparse Subspace Analysis

This is an in-development package for "sparse subspace analysis," a dimensionality reduction tool that aims to provide more interpretable low-D representations than PCA.

## Installation and Dependencies

This package can be installed by: 
```buildoutcfg
git clone https://github.com/jglaser2/ssa.git
cd ssa
pip install -e .
```
This package requires python 3.6 or higher for a succesful installation.


## Getting started
Please see the example jupyter notebooks in the notebooks folder: <br>
**`Example_1pop.ipynb`** is dimensionality reduction for a single population (like PCA) <br>
**`Example_2pops.ipynb`** is dimensionality reduction in a regression between two populations (like reduced rank regression)
